TODO list for after yalpack-0.1.7

For next release:
* Add a config file at /etc/yalpack.conf
      Status: Testing and documentation
      Task: Tighten up config verification mechanisms.
      Needed bugfix: Altering the top-level TMP directory can cause symlink repair failures
                     for software packaged before the config file edit and installed
                     afterwards.
* Word-wrap comments for legibility
      Status: Done (not yet uploaded)
* Search for script optimizations.
      Status: speed improvements may be possible for newfiles and pkglist.
* Further checks for POSIX-compliability.
      Status: All scripts intended for 0.1.8 run successfully with a dash login and /bin/sh -> dash.
              (Not yet uploaded; this will be re-tested prior to release.)

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
