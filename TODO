TODO list for after yalpack-0.1.7

Release milestone: full build testing (10.1 and 10.1 dev); retesting of script operations on
      installed systems. (ETA: "Before LFS 11.0 RC")

For next release:
* Add a config file at /etc/yalpack.conf
      Status: Documentation
      Tasks: * Tighten up config verification mechanisms: done (check for empty, identical and
               non-file-path variables)
             * Pass the config variables when one script calls another: done      
      Minor bug: Altering the top-level TMP directory can cause symlink repair failures
                 for software packaged before the config file edit and installed
                 afterwards.
                 Comment: This is an edge case, and fixing it would involve either making a
                 change to the package structure, or trying to detect [NAME]-[VER]/dest/. It
                 is not inconceivable that a package could have a genuine directory in that
                 location, which would cause more serious problems if 'repaired' by mistake.
                 Solution: Describe the edge case and mitigation strategies in the docs, in
                 case it does occur.
* Word-wrap comments for legibility
      Status: Done (not yet uploaded)
* Search for script optimizations.
      Status: * Marked speed improvements are coming for pkgcheck; drastic for packages with a high
                ratio of non-executable files (e.g. Python, the kernel, man-pages). 
              * liblist speed is up by about 20%. This makes pkginst, pkgup and restore-yalpack faster. 
              * Full rewrite of symlink path reporting results in a massive speed increase for
                restore-yalpack and (sometimes) install.sh. The corresponding check component in
                pkginst no longer qualifies as a bottleneck for large packages.
              * newfiles and pkglist are both snappier.
              (optimized scripts not yet uploaded)
* Further checks for POSIX-compliability.
      Status: All scripts intended for 0.1.8 run successfully with a dash login and /bin/sh -> dash.
              (Not yet uploaded; this will be re-tested prior to release.)

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
