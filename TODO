TODO list for yalpack-0.2.0

Please bear in mind that the dev branch is not ready for release; the documentation has not been updated, and more testing is needed.

For next release:
* Try to avoid extra extraction and repackaging calls as much as possible (pkginst, pkgup)
    Status: Probable working solution found. More testing needed.
    (fix is in dev branch)
* Compatibility with both SysVInit and systemd (pkgup)
    Status: Testing this will require new build scripts for systemd-based LFS
* Streamline newfiles (look at initial confirmation prompts)
    Status: Ready; will be in next release.
    (fix is in dev branch)
* Probably merge libcheck and libprecise (very similar functionality)
* More concise documentation
* Further optimizations
    Status: liblist and pkgcheck are faster. Except for installing and upgrading heavy packages, gains won't be as dramatic as 0.1.7 > 0.1.8. 
    (fix is in dev branch)

dev branch status:
An upgrade from glibc-2.33 to 2.34 was successful on the development LFS version on Aug. 16th. This was a merged-usr installation; further testing is needed on systems with true /bin, /lib and /sbin directories.

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
