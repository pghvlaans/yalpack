TODO list for after yalpack-0.1.7

For next release:
* Add a config file at /etc/yalpack.conf
      Status: Testing and documentation
      Tasks: * Tighten up config verification mechanisms: done (check for empty, identical and
               non-file-path variables)
             * Pass the config variables when one script calls another: done      
      Needed bugfix: Altering the top-level TMP directory can cause symlink repair failures
                     for software packaged before the config file edit and installed
                     afterwards.
* Word-wrap comments for legibility
      Status: Done (not yet uploaded)
* Search for script optimizations.
      Status: marked speed improvements are coming for pkgcheck; drastic for packages with a high
              ratio of non-executable files (e.g. Python, the kernel, man-pages). liblist speed
              is up by about 20%. This makes pkginst, pkgup and restore-yalpack faster. Also, 
              newfiles and libcheck are both snappier. (not yet uploaded)
* Further checks for POSIX-compliability.
      Status: All scripts intended for 0.1.8 run successfully with a dash login and /bin/sh -> dash.
              (Not yet uploaded; this will be re-tested prior to release.)

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
