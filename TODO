TODO list for after yalpack-0.1.8

Next release:
* Try to avoid extra extraction and repackaging calls as much as possible (pkginst, pkgup)
* Test systemd compatibility (pkgup)
* Streamline newfiles (look at initial confirmation prompts)
* Probably merge libcheck and libprecise (very similar functionality)
* More concise documentation
* Further optimizations

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
