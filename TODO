TODO list for after yalpack-0.1.8

Next release:
* Try to avoid extra extraction and repackaging calls as much as possible (pkginst, pkgup)
    Status: Probable working solution found. More testing needed.
* Compatibility with both SysVInit and systemd (pkgup)
    Status: Testing this will require new build scripts for systemd-based LFS
* Streamline newfiles (look at initial confirmation prompts)
    Status: Ready; will be in next release.
* Probably merge libcheck and libprecise (very similar functionality)
* More concise documentation
* Further optimizations
    Status: liblist and pkgcheck are faster. Except for installing and updating heavy packages, gains won't be as dramatic as 0.1.7 > 0.1.8. 

For the future:
* Retest glibc downgrades with selected compatible binaries already installed to the system
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 release candidate
* Full testing on the future LFS 11.0 stable release
