yalpack-0.1.7 Installation Guide

To install yalpack to your LFS-type system, run the Makefile as root. 
The following targets are available:
	
	make package: Recommended for all installations and upgrades.
	Install the yalpack scripts; these scripts are then used to make
	and install a package for yalpack. If yalpack is already installed
	on the system, the new scripts will be used to upgrade yalpack as
	a package instead. This helps avoid old bugs, etc. that have since
	been fixed.

	make install: Install yalpack under the chosen DESTDIR; install.sh
	will run at this time, creating and populating 
	/var/yalpack/pkgdata/SYMTREES if it does not already exist, as well
	as package tree backup directories at /var/log/yalpack and
	/root/.yalpack. A package for yalpack will not be created. This is
	the recommended method for upgrades; DESTDIR should be 
	/tmp/yalpack-0.1.7/dest. From here, make the NAME file and use 
	pkgmake and pkgup as usual. Because the outgoing pkgup script
	would be used for upgrades, "make package" is recommended for both
	upgrades and first-time installations.

	make clean: Removes compressed man pages from the source 
	directory.
	
	make uninstall: Remove the yalpack binaries, man pages and
	documentation from under DESTDIR. The yalpack directory
	(/var/yalpack by default) is made by install.sh and by running
	yalpack scripts for the first time, and so it must be removed
	manually if desired. The same applies for any yalpack package
	tree backup directories.

The following parameters can be set with the make call:

	DESTDIR: should be set to /tmp/yalpack-0.1.7/dest for upgrades
		 with "make install." Please note that "make package"
		 is the recommended installation and upgrade method.
	PREFIX (/usr): the prefix for the bin, sbin, doc, share and man
                       directories
	SHAREDIR (PREFIX/share): yalpack's directory under share
	SBINDIR (PREFIX/sbin): the installation directory for root-only
	  		       scripts
	BINDIR (PREFIX/bin): the destination directory for other
			     scripts
	MANDIR (SHAREDIR/man): the destination directory for man
			       files
	DOCDIR (SHAREDIR/doc): the destination directory for other
			       documentation
	TMP (/tmp): the top directory level for the yalpack build
		    destination.

All yalpack binaries are POSIX-compliant shell scripts, so feel free to
edit them to make changes to default working and data directories. The 
defaults are as follows:

	/var/yalpack/pkgdata: contains information on all yalpack 
	                      packages installed on the system
	/var/yalpack/packages: package tarballs are stored here if 
                               retained; all operations except for
			       package installation can be done without
			       them, however
	/var/yalpack/BIN-DEPS: contains files outlining the dynamic 
			       libraries used by each binary on the 
			       system
	/tmp/[NAME]-[VERSION]/dest: when compiling from source, the
				    output goes here; the target of 
				    pkgmake in package construction.

Any changes are most conveniently made before yalpack is installed or
upgraded. Please see "Customization" for details.

As of Linux From Scratch 10.1, three packages in the base book use
"make install," but do not have PKGDEST capabilities:
	
	bzip2
	sysvinit
	sysklogd

For workarounds related to  managing these packages with yalpack, see
README (/usr/share/doc/yalpack-0.1.7/README) or the pkgmake man page.
