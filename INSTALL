yalpack-0.1.1 Installation Guide

To install yalpack to your LFS-type system, run the Makefile as root. The following targets are available:

	make install: Install yalpack under the chosen DESTDIR. A package for yalpack will not be created. This is the recommended method for upgrades; DESTDIR should be /tmp/yalpack-0.1.1/dest. From here, make the NAME file and use pkgmake and pkgup as usual.

	make package: Recommended for initial installations. Install the yalpack binaries; these binaries are then used to make and install a package for yalpack.

	make clean: Removes compressed man pages from the source directory.
	
	make uninstall: Remove the yalpack binaries, man pages and documentation from under DESTDIR. The yalpack directory (/var/yalpack by default) is made by running yalpack scripts for the first time, and so it must be removed manually if desired.

The following parameters can be set with the make call:

	DESTDIR: should be set to /tmp/yalpack-0.1.1/dest for upgrades
	PREFIX (/usr): the prefix for the bin, doc and man directories
	SBINDIR (/sbin): the installation directory for root-only binaries
	BINDIR (PREFIX/bin): the destination directory for other binaries
	MANDIR (PREFIX/share/man): the destination directory for man files
	DOCDIR (PREFIX/share/doc): the destination directory for other documentation

All yalpack binaries are POSIX-compliant shell scripts, so feel free to edit them to make changes to default working and data directories. The defaults are as follows:

	/var/yalpack/pkgdata: contains information on all yalpack packages installed on the system
	/var/yalpack/packages: package tarballs are stored here; tarballs should be retained until upgraded or removed
	/var/yalpack/BIN-DEPS: contains files outlining the dynamic libraries used by each binary on the system
	/tmp/[NAME]-[VERSION]/dest: when compiling from source, the output goes here; the target of pkgmake in package construction.

If the value for /tmp/[NAME]-[VERSION]/dest has been changed, the PKGDIR and PKGDEST parameters in Makefile should be edited to reflect the changes.
