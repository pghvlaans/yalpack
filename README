wclock-0.1.0

wclock is a simple shell script to conveniently get times from around the world
in terminal emulators and tty. It interfaces with "date" and /usr/share/zoneinfo
to acquire time zones that match a user-provided search term (case- and space-
insensitive).

The following features are included for increased convenience:

* Extra cities: A list of cities, metro areas, etc. with a population of over 
  400,000 is referenced in case no matching time zone is found. For example,
  
    wclock washington 
  
  will return a time for Washington, DC using the America/New_York time zone.

* Country search: Look up time zones by country.

* Breaks: Use -b between search terms to retrieve the time in multiple
  locations:

    wclock los angeles -b sendai -b south africa

* Time and date check: use -t to find your local time at a given day and time in
  the search location:

    wclock -t 10:00 2021/07/13 -b finland

  Alternatively, use -l to find the time in the search location when it is the
  given time in your local time zone:

    wclock -l 10:00 2021/07/13 -b lagos

* Query mode: Use -q with a continent (or any other directory inside 
  /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix) to get a list of available time zones, e.g. 
  
    wclock -q asia 

  -q without further parameters gives a list of such directories.

*Dependencies*

wclock needs the following in place to work properly:

* tzdata (specifically, time zone data in /usr/share/zoneinfo)
* findutils
* coreutils
* grep
* less
* A POSIX-compliant shell, or any other shell with a POSIX compliance mode

The following are installation dependencies:

* sed
* gzip

These packages should be included on almost any Linux installation.

*Installation*

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

*Bug Reporting*

To report bugs or incorrect time zones, request alternate city spellings, etc.,
please feel free to open a GitHub issue or email the author directly.
