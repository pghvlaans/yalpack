CHANGELOG

** For tracking changes between yalpack-0.1.5 and the current repo **

2021-06-23
* Added "TODO"
	A list of tasks, planned changes, etc.

2021-06-24
* Changed bold text to underline (all scripts)
	Done because it is possible to stop underlining without resetting
	other tput commands. Renders as cyan on tty, which stands out
	well and is easy to read.
