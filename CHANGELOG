CHANGELOG

** For tracking changes between the yalpack-0.1.6 and the current repo **

2021-06-24
* Non-critical bugfix: changed secondary backup location to /root/.yalpack-backup
      This was done because /root/.yalpack is also used by libcheck, and install.sh
      would fail to move the backup data into the existing directory for upgrades
      to yalpack-0.1.5 or 0.1.6.
      
      To use the secondary backup without upgrading the package, copy the contents
      of the primary backup location (/var/log/yalpack) into /root/.yalpack. If 
      upgrading using a new git clone, no special action is needed.
