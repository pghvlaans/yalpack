.SH NAME
liblist \- generate dynamic library usage information for system binaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
liblist [-n|--new] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
liblist is a shell program provided by yalpack (Yet Anotehr Lfs PACKage manager) for collecting information about dynamic library usage by programs in the following locations:

\t /bin
\t /usr/*
\t /opt/*
\t /sbin

Running liblist as root will perform ldd on all such programs; information will be written to the following directory on a per-file basis:

\t /var/yalpack/BINDEPS/[NAME]/[NAME].libinfo

These data are used by liblist(1) and libprecise(1) to reveal which programs use a particular dynamic library. liblist is called in the course of executing pkgcheck(1), pkgup(1) and pkginst(1). These scripts will only call liblist to refresh the entire data collection when a package appears to have installed a library.

The liblist script can be edited to change any of these default locations to suit user preferences. This is best done before installation; all other yalpack scripts should be changed accordingly.
.SH OPTIONS
-n|--new - Make a new directory tree in /var/yalpack/BINDEPS (default)

file - Add library usage information for the specified file. A full path is needed.
.SH SEE ALSO
pkginst(1), pkgup(1), pkgcheck(1), liblist(1), libprecise(1)
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
