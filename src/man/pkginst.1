.SH NAME
pkginst \- install a pkgmake-made package in LFS
.SH SYNOPSIS
pkginst NAME-VERSION
.SH DESCRIPTION
pkginst is a shell program provided by yalpack (Yet Another Lfs PACKage manager) for installing a package made by pkgmake in LFS. The files in the package are copied to the appropriate places relative to the root directory, missing directories are made, and any absolute symlinks are redirected relative to root. 

In addition, .new files (all files in /etc and /home; others can be designated .new before making the package) are renamed or removed as necessary. Any remaining .new files are logged to /var/yalpack/pkgdata/NEWFILE-LOG for administrator convenience.

pkginst calls pkgcheck(1) to return information about installed programs, installed libraries, and any dynamic libraries used by the binaries in the package. By default, pkginst makes use of the following files for data recording:

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/TREES/[NAME] (a copy of the package tree is written here for reference)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/VER/[NAME] (a file with the package's version number)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-DEPS/[NAME]/libdeps (any libraries used by installed binaries)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-BINS/[NAME]/instbins (any installed programs)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-LIBS/[NAME]/libs (any installed libraries)

The pkginst script can be edited to change any of these default locations to suit user preferences. This is best done before installation, and in conjunction with the other yalpack scripts.
