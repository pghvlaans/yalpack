.SH NAME
pkginst \- install a pkgmake-made package in LFS
.SH SYNOPSIS
pkginst [-kr|--keep --root-own] NAME1-VERSION1 [NAME2-VERSION2] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
pkginst is a shell program provided by yalpack (Yet Another Lfs PACKage manager) for installing one or more packages made by pkgmake in LFS.

pkginst begins by evaluating .new files (all files in /etc and /home, by default; others can be designated .new before making the package). .new files are renamed or removed as necessary by comparing md5sums. Any remaining .new files are logged to /var/yalpack/pkgdata/NEWFILE-LOG for administrator convenience. When the package is extracted to root, such .new files will have the same ownership and permissions as the existing file on the system.

The handling of symlinks follows. Any absolute symlinks pointing to locations within the package tarball are redone relative to root. In addition, symlinks are logged.

The default behavior of pkginst is to preserve the ownership of all package contents. If this is not desirable (for example, an unprivileged user built the package contents and still owns them), the --root-own option will change ownership of all package contents to root before installation actually occurs. Regardless of the ownership of any directories in the package tarball, the names and permissions of previously-existing directories will not be changed.

Once these modifications to the package have been completed, the contents of [NAME]-[VERSION]/dest are re-archived as INPACKAGE.tar.xz and extracted over the root directory.

pkginst will run any executable install.sh file in the top level of the package tarball once the .new files, symlinks, name and versioning information have been documented and the contents have been installed.

From here, pkginst calls pkgcheck(1) to return information about installed programs, installed libraries, and any dynamic libraries used by the binaries in the package. By default, pkginst makes use of the following files for data recording:

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/TREES/[NAME] (a copy of the package tree is written here for reference)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/VER/[NAME] (a file with the package's version number)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-DEPS/[NAME]/libdeps (any libraries used by installed binaries)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-BINS/[NAME]/instbins (any installed programs)

\t /var/yalpack/pkgdata/PKG-LIBS/[NAME]/libs (any installed libraries)

When called in the course of pkginst, pkgcheck(1) will invoke liblist(1) to make a new collection of dynamic library information if recognized library files have been installed under any of the following locations or their subdirectories:

\t /lib
\t /lib64
\t /usr/lib
\t /usr/libexec
\t /usr/include

The pkginst and pkgcheck(1) scripts can be edited to change any of these default locations to suit user preferences. This is best done before installation, and in conjunction with the other yalpack scripts.
.SH OPTIONS
NAME - The name of the package.

VERSION - The package's version number. NAME alone is sufficient if the package name includes versioning information and matches the tarball.

-k|--keep - Retain the package tarball after installation.

-r|--root-own - Set the ownership of all package contents to root:root before installation. Useful for package contents that were built and are owned by a non-privileged user.
