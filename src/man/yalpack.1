.SH NAME
yalpack \- a basic POSIX-compliant package management solution for LFS/BLFS systems
.SH DESCRIPTION
yalpack is a collection of man pages and POSIX-compliant scripts intended to make managing packages more convenient on Linux From Scratch-based systems, particularly with respect to removing and upgrading packages, managing .new files and tracking dynamic library usage. The following root-use scripts and man pages are included:

\t /usr/sbin/pkgmake - pkgmake(1) - Turning compiled software into a yalpack package, ready to be installed.

\t /usr/sbin/pkginst - pkginst(1) - Installing yalpack-built packages.

\t /usr/sbin/pkgremove - pkgremove (1) - Removing yalpack-built packages.

\t /usr/sbin/pkgup - pkgup(1) - Upgrading yalpack-built packages.

\t /usr/sbin/pkgcheck - pkgcheck(1) - Checking and updating information about yalpack-built packages.

\t /usr/sbin/liblist - liblist(1) - Generating dynamic library usage information for dynamic binaries.

\t /usr/share/restore-yalpack - restore-yalpack(5) - Regenerate the yalpack data directory from a good package tree backup.

\t /usr/share/newfiles - newfiles(5) - Update, list and manage .new files belonging to yalpack-installed packages.

Another set of utility scripts is available for non-root users:

\t /usr/bin/pkglist - pkglist(1) - Show a list of installed packages with their version numbers (regex searching available).

\t /usr/bin/libcheck - libcheck(1) - Return installation and usage information for libraries matching a search term.

\t /usr/bin/libprecise - libprecise(1) - Return installation and usage information for a specific library.

\t /usr/bin/pkgfind - pkgfind(1) - Determine which yalpack-installed package provides a given file, directory or symlink.
.SH BASIC OPERATIONS
It is not necessary to know how to operate all of these scripts to get started with yalpack. The following basic commands are good to know:

\t make package

Run this command in the yalpack source directory to install or upgrade yalpack as a package. For upgrades, the new versions of all scripts will be used. This is the recommended method for all installations and upgrades of yalpack.

\t pkgmake [NAME]-[VERSION]

pkgmake will take compiled software in /tmp/[NAME]-[VERSION]/dest and turn it into a yalpack package. A NAME file with the package's name should be in the top part of the directory.

\t pkginst [NAME]-[VERSION]

Install a package over the root directory after evaluating .new files and repairing absolute symlinks. Perform package checks.

\t pkgup [NAME] [NAME]-[NEWVERSION]

Upgrade a package, removing extraneous files, etc.

\t pkgremove [NAME]

Remove a package from the system with any extraneous files.

These commands should be more than enough to get package management with yalpack off the ground. For tips about building software to be managed with yalpack, see /usr/share/doc/yalpack-0.1.7/README.
.SH CAUTIONS
yalpack has been tested with LFS 10.1; it has been verified not to remove the /usr/bin and /usr/sbin symlinks for merged-usr systems. It has not (and most likely will not be) tested with previous versions of Linux From Scratch.

Because some yalpack scripts call ldd(1) to check dynamic library usage, yalpack should not be used with glibc-2.26 or earlier versions. See the "Security" section in ldd(1) for a detailed explanation.

yalpack can be used at any point once the LFS system is in chroot or independent boot. Never use yalpack on the "host" system.
